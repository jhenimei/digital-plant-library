# digital-plant-library
Facilitating discovery and motivation to plant Arizona's native plants in the community through an interactive web-based catalog.

## ðŸ’¾ about the project
This project was initially conceptualized for a Python class honors project as a computer program before being developed as a web application for a database class honors project. Overall, the project implements **database organization, object-oriented programming, and control flow concepts** learned through both classes.

The web application took about 24 weeks from **September 2024 to February 2025** to designing the database structure, programming the app functions, coding the user interface, and deployment.
